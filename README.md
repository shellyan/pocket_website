A simple django project.

Summary: Create an application, using Python and Django that contains server-side and client-side logic.

##On the server
Expose a Django view that generates a set of 9 random integers, 9 digits in length, and returns that set to the client.  Every request from the client should result in a new set of integers.

##On the client
Render a grid or table, containing 3 columns and 3 rows (9 cells total).  Each cell should have its background color set to an RGB value corresponding to one of the 9 integer values retrieved from the server.  Include a button that, when clicked, cycles the cell colors forward in a clockwise manner.
